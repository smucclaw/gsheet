* DevMode

If you want to run a dev version of the Google Apps Script and pyrest codebase, you can launch a new gunicorn instance on, say, port 8081.

If somewhere in the top ten lines of the spreadsheet you have something like this, it will use that port instead

#+begin_example
// live updates TRUE      devMode port 8081
#+end_example

If you're actively editing the spreadsheet and the redraws are slowing you
down, set live updates to FALSE.
