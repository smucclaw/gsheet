"//","This rule illustrates some of the most common patterns in legal writing.
We will name these patterns in bold.

The rule itself is a regulative, or prescriptive, rule.
It prescribes, or regulates, some behaviour: some person must act in some way.
In this example,  a person â€¦ must sing.

The rule applies to some entities and not others.
In this example, it applies to a person who â€¦ walks; and eats, or drinks â€¦
That qualifier has the form of a constitutive rule:
A person qualifies as being subject to the rule if certain requirements are met.
In other words, a person counts as being relevant to the rule, falling within the ambit of the rule,
if (and only if) they meet certain criteria.
A couple of centuries ago, the legal theorist Coode called these criteria the ""legal case"",
and the person to whom they apply, the ""legal subject"".

The criteria fit into a ""Boolean structure"": walks, and eats or drinks.
The keywords ""not"", ""and"" and ""or"" are sufficient to combine all simple logical propositions.
In L4, as in legal writing, we use indentation (not parentheses) to group the expressions.

The rule prescribes that qualifying persons must sing: what Coode called the legal action.
The must is what linguists call a ""deontic modal"". May and shan't are two other deontic modals.

This example illustrates the basic elements of L4.
A ""must-do"" regulative rule contains, implicitly, a ""must-be"" constitutive rule.
The rule makes use of a Boolean structure to specify the qualifying criteria.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
