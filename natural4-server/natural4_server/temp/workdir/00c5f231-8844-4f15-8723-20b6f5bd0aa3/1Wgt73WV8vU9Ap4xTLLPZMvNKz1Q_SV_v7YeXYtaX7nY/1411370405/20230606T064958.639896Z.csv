We'll introduce Qualifies as an explicit defined term.

the regulative rule to the left, the constitutive rule to the right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"//","""Every Person who Qualifies must sing.""
This is the regulative essence of the rule.
The moving parts. The dynamics. Who does what by when? Entities are acting in time.
Regulative rules are drawn like a +.

""A Qualifying Person is one who walks, and eats or drinks.""
This is the constitutive essence of the rule.
The statics. The yes or no logic. Does this thing count as that, for these purposes?
Constitutive rules are drawn like a T.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"//","Keen readers will notice that this rule has no deadline – so the system fills in the default deadline ""eventually"".
This is meant to remind you to add a deadline.
As every parent of a small child knows, a regulative rule without a deadline lacks teeth –
the subject of the rule could always weasel out with ""well, I plan to, I just haven't gotten around to it yet.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
